This was my final exam for a coding class. The names are strange: "thomureFinalExam7.cpp" because that was how we were to name our files.

For the main file: "thomureFinalExam7.cpp", the top of the program describes to my teacher of what I added to acumulate points, then the suggested things that I didn't do. The functions are stored in "thomureFinalExamClasses7.h". I have made each account on my program a customer with a "privelege": 0 for customer, 1 for employee, 2 for manager, and 3 for owner, each with thier own selection screen of what they can do.
